# Introduction to philosophy, psychology and theology

> This book aims to take you, dear reader, in a journey into the depths of your mind. It enables you to state aloud your take on existence, mind, morals, and believes. Many aren't able to articulates their ideas about these fundamental topics without relying on what they have been fed from social media, news, or what their society deems acceptable. Whereas everyone are ferosiously defenders of their believes by nature, only few have the tools to fight correctly for what they stand for. Hence, I am going to give you a set of classical questions that we are going to answer based on many points of view. This method is, as far as I am concerned, a powerful method that uses examples to teach. Moreover, the linguistic barrier imposed by the sofisticated style of writing you might find in research papers won't be an issue for you here. Finally, I hope, dear reader, that you get what deserve from this book: to become a thinker for yourself, in your own words, and with your own ideology.
